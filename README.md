## Architecture  

The application is based on the **MVC architecture**, which separates concerns for better maintainability:  

1. **Model**: Manages the database operations (CRUD) using MySQL.  
2. **View**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.  
3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary, handling user inputs and coordinating between the model and the view.
